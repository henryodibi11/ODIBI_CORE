## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Graduation tracking needs cohort-based analysis

### Backstory
In the Education domain, graduation tracking needs cohort-based analysis. The current system ingests data from PARQUET, JSON sources, but lacks proper attendance, enrollments, graduations reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles multi source conformance patterns to improve completion_rate and enrollment_rate visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a multi source conformance pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates completion_rate, enrollment_rate, and refreshes every 16w with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
completion_rate, enrollment_rate

### Data Formats
PARQUET, JSON
