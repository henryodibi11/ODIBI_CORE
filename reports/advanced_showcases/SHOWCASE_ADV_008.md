## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Fleet uptime dropped to 92%

### Backstory
The IoT team is facing challenges with fleet uptime dropped to 92%. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (AVRO, JSON), making it difficult to track connectivity_ratio and message_latency. The pipeline needs to consolidate telemetry, events, device_metadata data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade FanIn DAG that ingests AVRO, JSON data, applies 3 entity joins, computes connectivity_ratio, message_latency, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
connectivity_ratio, message_latency

### Data Formats
AVRO, JSON
