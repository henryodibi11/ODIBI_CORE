## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Budget variance analysis needs trend detection

### Backstory
The PublicData team is facing challenges with budget variance analysis needs trend detection. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, PARQUET), making it difficult to track violation_resolution_rate and service_coverage. The pipeline needs to consolidate census_tracts, weather_stations, permits data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade FanIn DAG that ingests CSV, PARQUET data, applies 3 entity joins, computes violation_resolution_rate, service_coverage, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
violation_resolution_rate, service_coverage

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
