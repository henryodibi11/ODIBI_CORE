## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Budget variance analysis needs trend detection

### Backstory
In the PublicData domain, budget variance analysis needs trend detection. The current system ingests data from CSV, JSON sources, but lacks proper violations, weather_stations, traffic_sensors reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles quality branch patterns to improve response_time_311 and violation_resolution_rate visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a quality branch pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates response_time_311, violation_resolution_rate, and refreshes every 1d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
response_time_311, violation_resolution_rate

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
