## Manufacturing Scd2 Merge Pipeline

**Domain:** Manufacturing  
**Batch Type:** Transformation  
**Archetype:** Scd2 Merge  
**DAG Topology:** Diamond  
**Complexity Level:** Extreme  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-02T21:59:52.274569  
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
OEE trending down on Line 3

### Backstory
The Manufacturing team is facing challenges with oee trending down on line 3. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, JSON), making it difficult to track MTBF and OEE. The pipeline needs to consolidate quality_inspections, inventory, equipment data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Build a scd2 merge pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates MTBF, OEE, and refreshes every 8h with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
MTBF, OEE

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
