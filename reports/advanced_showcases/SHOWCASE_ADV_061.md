## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Trading desk reports settlement lags

### Backstory
The Finance team is facing challenges with trading desk reports settlement lags. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (PARQUET, JSON), making it difficult to track margin_utilization and VaR. The pipeline needs to consolidate counterparties, portfolios, trades data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Build a star schema pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates margin_utilization, VaR, and refreshes every 15min with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
margin_utilization, VaR

### Data Formats
PARQUET, JSON
