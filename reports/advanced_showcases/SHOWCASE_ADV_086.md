## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
LOS trending higher for cardiac cases

### Backstory
The Healthcare team is facing challenges with los trending higher for cardiac cases. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, PARQUET), making it difficult to track time_to_treatment and claim_denial_rate. The pipeline needs to consolidate diagnoses, claims, providers data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Build a star schema pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates time_to_treatment, claim_denial_rate, and refreshes every 30d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
time_to_treatment, claim_denial_rate

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
