## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Quality defects spiking in welding

### Backstory
Quality defects spiking in welding. The Manufacturing organization needs a robust pipeline to process work_orders, quality_inspections, equipment data from multiple sources (CSV, PARQUET, JSON). Key metrics like yield_rate and OEE require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade FanIn DAG that ingests CSV, PARQUET, JSON data, applies 3 entity joins, computes yield_rate, OEE, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
yield_rate, OEE

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET, JSON
