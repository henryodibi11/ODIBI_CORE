## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Inventory sync lagging 20 mins

### Backstory
Inventory sync lagging 20 mins. The Retail organization needs a robust pipeline to process transactions, products, promotions data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON). Key metrics like return_rate and inventory_turnover require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a high-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track return_rate, inventory_turnover with 1d refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
return_rate, inventory_turnover

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

**Archetype:** Windowed Kpi  
**DAG Topology:** Linear  
**Steps Executed:** 7

**Design Rationale:**  
RFM scoring identifies VIP customers

**Trade-offs:**  
30d cohort window balances retention signal vs recency

## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

**Business Context**: In Retail, RFM scoring identifies VIP customers. This showcase validated the windowed kpi pattern for handling transactions, products data.

**Pipeline Execution**: ODIBI_CORE successfully orchestrated 7 steps across Linear topology in 0ms. The orchestrator fired 4 lifecycle events, providing real-time observability throughout the execution.

**Data Lineage**: Tracker captured 10 schema snapshots, preserving complete before/after states for audit trail. This demonstrates ODIBI_CORE's truth-preserving lineage - you can see exactly what happened to your data at each transformation step.

**Data Quality**: 1 validation checks ensured data integrity before publishing to the gold layer. Quality gates caught potential issues early, preventing bad data from reaching analytics consumers.

**Design Trade-offs**: 30d cohort window balances retention signal vs recency. These choices balanced return_rate requirements with operational constraints.

**Framework Insight**: This domain-batch showcase exercised 7 ODIBI_CORE components (ConfigLoader, Orchestrator, Tracker, EventEmitter, DAGBuilder, DAGExecutor), demonstrating seamless integration across the native stack. No external dependencies - pure Python orchestration.
