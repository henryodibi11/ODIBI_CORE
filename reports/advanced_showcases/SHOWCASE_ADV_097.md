## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Outage detection lagging 8 mins

### Backstory
In the Energy domain, outage detection lagging 8 mins. The current system ingests data from CSV, PARQUET sources, but lacks proper meters, substations, circuits reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles star schema patterns to improve forecast_accuracy and transmission_loss visibility.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a high-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track forecast_accuracy, transmission_loss with 1min refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
forecast_accuracy, transmission_loss

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
