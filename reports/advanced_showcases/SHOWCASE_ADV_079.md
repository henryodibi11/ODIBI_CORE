## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Graduation tracking needs cohort-based analysis

### Backstory
In the Education domain, graduation tracking needs cohort-based analysis. The current system ingests data from CSV, JSON sources, but lacks proper enrollments, courses, assessments reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles hierarchical agg patterns to improve attendance_avg and completion_rate visibility.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade FanOut DAG that ingests CSV, JSON data, applies 3 entity joins, computes attendance_avg, completion_rate, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
attendance_avg, completion_rate

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
