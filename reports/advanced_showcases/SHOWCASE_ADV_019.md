## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Voltage variance spiking in grid sector 4

### Backstory
Voltage variance spiking in grid sector 4. The Energy organization needs a robust pipeline to process transformers, readings, circuits data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON). Key metrics like peak_demand and outage_minutes require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a moderate-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track peak_demand, outage_minutes with 1h refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
peak_demand, outage_minutes

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
