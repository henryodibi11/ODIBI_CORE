## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Carrier OTP degraded 8% this quarter

### Backstory
The Logistics team is facing challenges with carrier otp degraded 8% this quarter. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, PARQUET), making it difficult to track dwell_time and cost_per_mile. The pipeline needs to consolidate carriers, shipments, orders data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Build a windowed kpi pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates dwell_time, cost_per_mile, and refreshes every 30d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
dwell_time, cost_per_mile

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
