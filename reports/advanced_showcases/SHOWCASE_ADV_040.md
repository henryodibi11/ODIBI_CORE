## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
311 response time up 18% in District 5

### Backstory
In the PublicData domain, 311 response time up 18% in district 5. The current system ingests data from PARQUET, JSON sources, but lacks proper permits, 311_requests, weather_stations reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles windowed kpi patterns to improve violation_resolution_rate and permit_approval_days visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a windowed kpi pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates violation_resolution_rate, permit_approval_days, and refreshes every 1d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
violation_resolution_rate, permit_approval_days

### Data Formats
PARQUET, JSON
