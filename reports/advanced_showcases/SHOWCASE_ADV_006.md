## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Quality defects spiking in welding

### Backstory
In the Manufacturing domain, quality defects spiking in welding. The current system ingests data from PARQUET, JSON sources, but lacks proper inventory, quality_inspections, production_runs reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles multi source conformance patterns to improve defect_ppm and downtime_hours visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a multi source conformance pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates defect_ppm, downtime_hours, and refreshes every 5min with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
defect_ppm, downtime_hours

### Data Formats
PARQUET, JSON
