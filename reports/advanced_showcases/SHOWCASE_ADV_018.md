## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Readmission rate 18% vs 12% benchmark

### Backstory
Readmission rate 18% vs 12% benchmark. The Healthcare organization needs a robust pipeline to process patients, diagnoses, medications data from multiple sources (PARQUET, JSON). Key metrics like readmission_rate and claim_denial_rate require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Build a multi source conformance pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates readmission_rate, claim_denial_rate, and refreshes every 1d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
readmission_rate, claim_denial_rate

### Data Formats
PARQUET, JSON
