## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Budget variance analysis needs trend detection

### Backstory
The PublicData team is facing challenges with budget variance analysis needs trend detection. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (PARQUET, JSON), making it difficult to track permit_approval_days and budget_variance. The pipeline needs to consolidate weather_stations, traffic_sensors, 311_requests data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade Star DAG that ingests PARQUET, JSON data, applies 3 entity joins, computes permit_approval_days, budget_variance, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
permit_approval_days, budget_variance

### Data Formats
PARQUET, JSON
