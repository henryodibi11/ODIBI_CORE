## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Voltage variance spiking in grid sector 4

### Backstory
Voltage variance spiking in grid sector 4. The Energy organization needs a robust pipeline to process transformers, demand_forecasts, outages data from multiple sources (CSV, AVRO). Key metrics like outage_minutes and voltage_variance require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Build a multi source conformance pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates outage_minutes, voltage_variance, and refreshes every 1d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
outage_minutes, voltage_variance

### Data Formats
CSV, AVRO
