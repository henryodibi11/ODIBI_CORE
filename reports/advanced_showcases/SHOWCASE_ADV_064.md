## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Exception handling needs automated triage

### Backstory
Exception handling needs automated triage. The Logistics organization needs a robust pipeline to process tracking_events, facilities, shipments data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON). Key metrics like damage_rate and carrier_performance require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade FanOut DAG that ingests CSV, JSON data, applies 3 entity joins, computes damage_rate, carrier_performance, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
damage_rate, carrier_performance

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
