## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
ETA prediction accuracy at 67%

### Backstory
In the Logistics domain, eta prediction accuracy at 67%. The current system ingests data from CSV, JSON sources, but lacks proper orders, routes, facilities reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles multi source conformance patterns to improve damage_rate and dwell_time visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a multi source conformance pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates damage_rate, dwell_time, and refreshes every 15min with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
damage_rate, dwell_time

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
