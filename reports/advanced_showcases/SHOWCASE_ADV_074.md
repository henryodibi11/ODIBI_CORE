## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Exception handling needs automated triage

### Backstory
In the Logistics domain, exception handling needs automated triage. The current system ingests data from CSV, PARQUET sources, but lacks proper exceptions, tracking_events, orders reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles hierarchical agg patterns to improve damage_rate and cost_per_mile visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a hierarchical agg pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates damage_rate, cost_per_mile, and refreshes every 1d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
damage_rate, cost_per_mile

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
