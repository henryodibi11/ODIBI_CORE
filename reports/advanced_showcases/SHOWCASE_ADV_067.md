## Energy Scd2 Merge Pipeline

**Domain:** Energy  
**Batch Type:** Transformation  
**Archetype:** Scd2 Merge  
**DAG Topology:** Diamond  
**Complexity Level:** High  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-02T21:59:52.098060  
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Outage detection lagging 8 mins

### Backstory
In the Energy domain, outage detection lagging 8 mins. The current system ingests data from PARQUET, JSON sources, but lacks proper outages, readings, transformers reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles scd2 merge patterns to improve voltage_variance and forecast_accuracy visibility.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a high-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track voltage_variance, forecast_accuracy with 1h refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
voltage_variance, forecast_accuracy

### Data Formats
PARQUET, JSON
