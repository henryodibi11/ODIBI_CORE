## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Exception handling needs automated triage

### Backstory
Exception handling needs automated triage. The Logistics organization needs a robust pipeline to process orders, shipments, exceptions data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON). Key metrics like damage_rate and dwell_time require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Build a hierarchical agg pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates damage_rate, dwell_time, and refreshes every 15min with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
damage_rate, dwell_time

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
