## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Fleet uptime dropped to 92%

### Backstory
The IoT team is facing challenges with fleet uptime dropped to 92%. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (PARQUET, AVRO), making it difficult to track device_uptime and firmware_adoption. The pipeline needs to consolidate sensors, device_metadata, firmware_versions data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Build a parallel transform pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates device_uptime, firmware_adoption, and refreshes every 7d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
device_uptime, firmware_adoption

### Data Formats
PARQUET, AVRO
