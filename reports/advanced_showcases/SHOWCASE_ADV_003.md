## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Risk team needs real-time VaR

### Backstory
The Finance team is facing challenges with risk team needs real-time var. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, PARQUET), making it difficult to track trade_volume and VaR. The pipeline needs to consolidate transactions, portfolios, counterparties data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade FanIn DAG that ingests CSV, PARQUET data, applies 3 entity joins, computes trade_volume, VaR, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
trade_volume, VaR

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
