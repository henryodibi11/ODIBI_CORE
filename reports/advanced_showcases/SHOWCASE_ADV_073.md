## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Anomaly detection needs low-latency processing

### Backstory
In the IoT domain, anomaly detection needs low-latency processing. The current system ingests data from PARQUET, AVRO sources, but lacks proper events, sensors, devices reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles streaming enrich patterns to improve battery_life and device_uptime visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a streaming enrich pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates battery_life, device_uptime, and refreshes every 7d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
battery_life, device_uptime

### Data Formats
PARQUET, AVRO
