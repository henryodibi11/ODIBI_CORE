## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Predictive maintenance needs failure patterns

### Backstory
The Manufacturing team is facing challenges with predictive maintenance needs failure patterns. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, PARQUET), making it difficult to track yield_rate and MTTR. The pipeline needs to consolidate equipment, production_runs, work_orders data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a high-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track yield_rate, MTTR with 5min refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
yield_rate, MTTR

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
