## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Customer segments need real-time refresh

### Backstory
The Retail team is facing challenges with customer segments need real-time refresh. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, JSON), making it difficult to track basket_size and customer_ltv. The pipeline needs to consolidate products, stores, customers data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade Linear DAG that ingests CSV, JSON data, applies 3 entity joins, computes basket_size, customer_ltv, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
basket_size, customer_ltv

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
