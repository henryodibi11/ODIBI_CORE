## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
ETA prediction accuracy at 67%

### Backstory
ETA prediction accuracy at 67%. The Logistics organization needs a robust pipeline to process carriers, exceptions, facilities data from multiple sources (CSV, PARQUET, AVRO, JSON). Key metrics like eta_accuracy and on_time_percentage require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Build a multi source conformance pipeline that consolidates 4-format sources, calculates eta_accuracy, on_time_percentage, and refreshes every 1d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
eta_accuracy, on_time_percentage

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET, AVRO, JSON
