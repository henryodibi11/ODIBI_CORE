## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Peak demand forecast off by 12%

### Backstory
In the Energy domain, peak demand forecast off by 12%. The current system ingests data from CSV, JSON sources, but lacks proper outages, readings, circuits reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles scd2 merge patterns to improve transmission_loss and forecast_accuracy visibility.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a high-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track transmission_loss, forecast_accuracy with 1h refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
transmission_loss, forecast_accuracy

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
