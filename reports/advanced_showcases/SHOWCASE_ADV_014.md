## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Inventory sync lagging 20 mins

### Backstory
The Retail team is facing challenges with inventory sync lagging 20 mins. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, JSON), making it difficult to track promo_lift and customer_ltv. The pipeline needs to consolidate returns, inventory, transactions data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a moderate-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track promo_lift, customer_ltv with 30d refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
promo_lift, customer_ltv

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
