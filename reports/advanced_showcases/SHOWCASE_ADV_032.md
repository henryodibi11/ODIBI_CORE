## Manufacturing Windowed Kpi Pipeline

**Domain:** Manufacturing  
**Batch Type:** Format  
**Archetype:** Windowed Kpi  
**DAG Topology:** Linear  
**Complexity Level:** High

## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Predictive maintenance needs failure patterns

### Backstory
In the Manufacturing domain, predictive maintenance needs failure patterns. The current system ingests data from PARQUET, JSON sources, but lacks proper defects, inventory, work_orders reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles windowed kpi patterns to improve inventory_turns and OEE visibility.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a high-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track inventory_turns, OEE with 8h refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
inventory_turns, OEE

### Data Formats
PARQUET, JSON
