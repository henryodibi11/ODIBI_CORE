## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
OEE trending down on Line 3

### Backstory
In the Manufacturing domain, oee trending down on line 3. The current system ingests data from PARQUET, AVRO sources, but lacks proper quality_inspections, equipment, maintenance_logs reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles windowed kpi patterns to improve defect_ppm and yield_rate visibility.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a moderate-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track defect_ppm, yield_rate with 5min refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
defect_ppm, yield_rate

### Data Formats
PARQUET, AVRO
