## Finance Star Schema Pipeline

**Domain:** Finance  
**Batch Type:** Transformation  
**Archetype:** Star Schema  
**DAG Topology:** Star  
**Complexity Level:** Extreme  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-02T22:12:19.280755  
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Risk team needs real-time VaR

### Backstory
In the Finance domain, risk team needs real-time var. The current system ingests data from CSV, JSON sources, but lacks proper accounts, counterparties, transactions reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles star schema patterns to improve VaR and settlement_lag visibility.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade Star DAG that ingests CSV, JSON data, applies 3 entity joins, computes VaR, settlement_lag, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
VaR, settlement_lag

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

**Archetype:** Star Schema  
**DAG Topology:** Star  
**Steps Executed:** 11

**Design Rationale:**  
SCD2 on instruments preserves historical pricing

**Trade-offs:**  
Caching PnL aggregates reduces query load 40%

## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

**Business Context**: In Finance, SCD2 on instruments preserves historical pricing. This showcase validated the star schema pattern for handling accounts, counterparties data.

**Pipeline Execution**: ODIBI_CORE expertly handled 11 steps across Star topology in 0ms. The orchestrator fired 4 lifecycle events, providing real-time observability throughout the execution.

**Data Lineage**: Tracker captured 20 schema snapshots, preserving complete before/after states for audit trail. This demonstrates ODIBI_CORE's truth-preserving lineage - you can see exactly what happened to your data at each transformation step.

**Data Quality**: 1 validation checks ensured data integrity before publishing to the gold layer. Quality gates caught potential issues early, preventing bad data from reaching analytics consumers.

**Design Trade-offs**: Caching PnL aggregates reduces query load 40%. These choices balanced VaR requirements with operational constraints.

**Framework Insight**: This transformation-batch showcase exercised 7 ODIBI_CORE components (ConfigLoader, Orchestrator, Tracker, EventEmitter, DAGBuilder, DAGExecutor), demonstrating seamless integration across the native stack. No external dependencies - pure Python orchestration.
