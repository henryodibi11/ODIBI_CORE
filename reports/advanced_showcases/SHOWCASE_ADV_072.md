## Manufacturing Scd2 Merge Pipeline

**Domain:** Manufacturing  
**Batch Type:** Transformation  
**Archetype:** Scd2 Merge  
**DAG Topology:** Diamond  
**Complexity Level:** High  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-02T21:59:52.153060  
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Predictive maintenance needs failure patterns

### Backstory
The Manufacturing team is facing challenges with predictive maintenance needs failure patterns. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, AVRO), making it difficult to track MTTR and downtime_hours. The pipeline needs to consolidate production_runs, inventory, equipment data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade Diamond DAG that ingests CSV, AVRO data, applies 3 entity joins, computes MTTR, downtime_hours, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
MTTR, downtime_hours

### Data Formats
CSV, AVRO
