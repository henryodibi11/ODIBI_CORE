## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
311 response time up 18% in District 5

### Backstory
The PublicData team is facing challenges with 311 response time up 18% in district 5. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, PARQUET), making it difficult to track response_time_311 and permit_approval_days. The pipeline needs to consolidate 311_requests, permits, budgets data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a extreme-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track response_time_311, permit_approval_days with 30d refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
response_time_311, permit_approval_days

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
