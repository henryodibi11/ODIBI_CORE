## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Quality defects spiking in welding

### Backstory
Quality defects spiking in welding. The Manufacturing organization needs a robust pipeline to process inventory, production_runs, equipment data from multiple sources (AVRO, JSON). Key metrics like inventory_turns and MTTR require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade Parallel DAG that ingests AVRO, JSON data, applies 3 entity joins, computes inventory_turns, MTTR, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
inventory_turns, MTTR

### Data Formats
AVRO, JSON
