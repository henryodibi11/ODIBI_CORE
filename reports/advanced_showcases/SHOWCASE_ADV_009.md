## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Firmware v2.1 rollout shows instability

### Backstory
The IoT team is facing challenges with firmware v2.1 rollout shows instability. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (PARQUET, AVRO), making it difficult to track message_latency and connectivity_ratio. The pipeline needs to consolidate sensors, firmware_versions, device_metadata data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Build a windowed kpi pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates message_latency, connectivity_ratio, and refreshes every 7d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
message_latency, connectivity_ratio

### Data Formats
PARQUET, AVRO
