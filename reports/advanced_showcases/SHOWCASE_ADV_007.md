## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Anomaly detection needs low-latency processing

### Backstory
In the IoT domain, anomaly detection needs low-latency processing. The current system ingests data from AVRO, JSON sources, but lacks proper devices, events, telemetry reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles windowed kpi patterns to improve device_uptime and firmware_adoption visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a windowed kpi pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates device_uptime, firmware_adoption, and refreshes every 7d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
device_uptime, firmware_adoption

### Data Formats
AVRO, JSON

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

**Archetype:** Windowed Kpi  
**DAG Topology:** Linear  
**Steps Executed:** 7

**Design Rationale:**  
1-min tumbling windows aggregate telemetry streams

**Trade-offs:**  
Watermark = 2min handles most late arrivals

---

## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

**Business Context**: In IoT, 1-min tumbling windows aggregate telemetry streams. This showcase validated the windowed kpi pattern for handling devices, events data.

**Pipeline Execution**: ODIBI_CORE successfully orchestrated 7 steps across Linear topology in 0ms. The orchestrator fired 4 lifecycle events, providing real-time observability throughout the execution.

**Data Lineage**: Tracker captured 8 schema snapshots, preserving complete before/after states for audit trail. This demonstrates ODIBI_CORE's truth-preserving lineage - you can see exactly what happened to your data at each transformation step.

**Data Quality**: 1 validation checks ensured data integrity before publishing to the gold layer. Quality gates caught potential issues early, preventing bad data from reaching analytics consumers.

**Design Trade-offs**: Watermark = 2min handles most late arrivals. These choices balanced device_uptime requirements with operational constraints.

**Framework Insight**: This domain-batch showcase exercised 7 ODIBI_CORE components (ConfigLoader, Orchestrator, Tracker, EventEmitter, DAGBuilder, DAGExecutor), demonstrating seamless integration across the native stack. No external dependencies - pure Python orchestration.
