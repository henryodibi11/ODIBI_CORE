## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Risk team needs real-time VaR

### Backstory
Risk team needs real-time VaR. The Finance organization needs a robust pipeline to process portfolios, transactions, instruments data from multiple sources (CSV, PARQUET). Key metrics like trade_volume and counterparty_risk require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade Linear DAG that ingests CSV, PARQUET data, applies 3 entity joins, computes trade_volume, counterparty_risk, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
trade_volume, counterparty_risk

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
