## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Carrier OTP degraded 8% this quarter

### Backstory
Carrier OTP degraded 8% this quarter. The Logistics organization needs a robust pipeline to process routes, facilities, orders data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON). Key metrics like cost_per_mile and dwell_time require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Build a quality branch pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates cost_per_mile, dwell_time, and refreshes every 30d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
cost_per_mile, dwell_time

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
