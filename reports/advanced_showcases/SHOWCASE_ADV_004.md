## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Predictive maintenance needs failure patterns

### Backstory
Predictive maintenance needs failure patterns. The Manufacturing organization needs a robust pipeline to process equipment, maintenance_logs, defects data from multiple sources (PARQUET, JSON). Key metrics like defect_ppm and inventory_turns require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade FanIn DAG that ingests PARQUET, JSON data, applies 3 entity joins, computes defect_ppm, inventory_turns, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
defect_ppm, inventory_turns

### Data Formats
PARQUET, JSON

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

**Archetype:** Multi Source Conformance  
**DAG Topology:** FanIn  
**Steps Executed:** 0

**Design Rationale:**  
5-min sensor windows aggregate PLC streams before join

**Trade-offs:**  
Late data tolerance = 2min trade-off coverage vs latency
