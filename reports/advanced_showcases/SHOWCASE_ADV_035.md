## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Customer segments need real-time refresh

### Backstory
The Retail team is facing challenges with customer segments need real-time refresh. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (PARQUET, AVRO), making it difficult to track conversion_rate and return_rate. The pipeline needs to consolidate returns, customers, promotions data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade Linear DAG that ingests PARQUET, AVRO data, applies 3 entity joins, computes conversion_rate, return_rate, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
conversion_rate, return_rate

### Data Formats
PARQUET, AVRO
