## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Graduation tracking needs cohort-based analysis

### Backstory
In the Education domain, graduation tracking needs cohort-based analysis. The current system ingests data from PARQUET, JSON sources, but lacks proper enrollments, graduations, instructors reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles multi source conformance patterns to improve attendance_avg and instructor_rating visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a multi source conformance pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates attendance_avg, instructor_rating, and refreshes every 7d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
attendance_avg, instructor_rating

### Data Formats
PARQUET, JSON
