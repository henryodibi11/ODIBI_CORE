## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Readmission rate 18% vs 12% benchmark

### Backstory
Readmission rate 18% vs 12% benchmark. The Healthcare organization needs a robust pipeline to process claims, providers, lab_results data from multiple sources (CSV, PARQUET). Key metrics like claim_denial_rate and readmission_rate require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Build a windowed kpi pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates claim_denial_rate, readmission_rate, and refreshes every 30d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
claim_denial_rate, readmission_rate

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
