## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Peak demand forecast off by 12%

### Backstory
The Energy team is facing challenges with peak demand forecast off by 12%. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, JSON), making it difficult to track peak_demand and outage_minutes. The pipeline needs to consolidate meters, circuits, outages data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a moderate-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track peak_demand, outage_minutes with 1d refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
peak_demand, outage_minutes

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
