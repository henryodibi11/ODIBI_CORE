## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Voltage variance spiking in grid sector 4

### Backstory
In the Energy domain, voltage variance spiking in grid sector 4. The current system ingests data from CSV, JSON sources, but lacks proper circuits, demand_forecasts, outages reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles scd2 merge patterns to improve load_factor and voltage_variance visibility.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a high-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track load_factor, voltage_variance with 1d refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
load_factor, voltage_variance

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
