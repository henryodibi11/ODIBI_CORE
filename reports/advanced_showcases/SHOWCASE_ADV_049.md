## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Graduation tracking needs cohort-based analysis

### Backstory
In the Education domain, graduation tracking needs cohort-based analysis. The current system ingests data from CSV, PARQUET sources, but lacks proper enrollments, assessments, courses reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles windowed kpi patterns to improve instructor_rating and completion_rate visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a windowed kpi pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates instructor_rating, completion_rate, and refreshes every 7d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
instructor_rating, completion_rate

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
