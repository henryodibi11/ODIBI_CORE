## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Completion rate 68% vs 75% target

### Backstory
The Education team is facing challenges with completion rate 68% vs 75% target. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (PARQUET, AVRO), making it difficult to track graduation_rate and attendance_avg. The pipeline needs to consolidate assessments, courses, graduations data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Build a windowed kpi pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates graduation_rate, attendance_avg, and refreshes every 4y with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
graduation_rate, attendance_avg

### Data Formats
PARQUET, AVRO
