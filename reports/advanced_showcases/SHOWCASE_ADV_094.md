## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Exception handling needs automated triage

### Backstory
The Logistics team is facing challenges with exception handling needs automated triage. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (CSV, JSON), making it difficult to track on_time_percentage and dwell_time. The pipeline needs to consolidate orders, facilities, exceptions data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a high-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track on_time_percentage, dwell_time with 15min refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
on_time_percentage, dwell_time

### Data Formats
CSV, JSON
