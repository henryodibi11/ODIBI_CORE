## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Outage detection lagging 8 mins

### Backstory
The Energy team is facing challenges with outage detection lagging 8 mins. Data is scattered across 3 different formats (CSV, PARQUET, AVRO), making it difficult to track forecast_accuracy and peak_demand. The pipeline needs to consolidate readings, transformers, outages data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Create a production-grade FanIn DAG that ingests CSV, PARQUET, AVRO data, applies 3 entity joins, computes forecast_accuracy, peak_demand, and publishes analytics-ready datasets.

### KPIs Tracked
forecast_accuracy, peak_demand

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET, AVRO
