## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Outage detection lagging 8 mins

### Backstory
In the Energy domain, outage detection lagging 8 mins. The current system ingests data from CSV, PARQUET sources, but lacks proper circuits, readings, meters reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles multi source conformance patterns to improve peak_demand and voltage_variance visibility.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a high-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track peak_demand, voltage_variance with 1h refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
peak_demand, voltage_variance

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
