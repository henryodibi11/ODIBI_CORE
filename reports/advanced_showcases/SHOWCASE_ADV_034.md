## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
ETA prediction accuracy at 67%

### Backstory
ETA prediction accuracy at 67%. The Logistics organization needs a robust pipeline to process carriers, facilities, tracking_events data from multiple sources (CSV, PARQUET, JSON). Key metrics like eta_accuracy and cost_per_mile require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Build a multi source conformance pipeline that consolidates 3-format sources, calculates eta_accuracy, cost_per_mile, and refreshes every 15min with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
eta_accuracy, cost_per_mile

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET, JSON
