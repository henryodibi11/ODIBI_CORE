## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Predictive maintenance needs failure patterns

### Backstory
In the Manufacturing domain, predictive maintenance needs failure patterns. The current system ingests data from CSV, AVRO sources, but lacks proper maintenance_logs, inventory, production_runs reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles multi source conformance patterns to improve downtime_hours and defect_ppm visibility.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a high-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track downtime_hours, defect_ppm with 7d refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
downtime_hours, defect_ppm

### Data Formats
CSV, AVRO
