## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Regulatory reporting requires complete audit trail

### Backstory
The Finance team is facing challenges with regulatory reporting requires complete audit trail. Data is scattered across 2 different formats (JSON, PARQUET), making it difficult to track settlement_lag and trade_volume. The pipeline needs to consolidate accounts, transactions, trades data to provide a unified view for decision-making.

### Data Goal
Build a windowed kpi pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates settlement_lag, trade_volume, and refreshes every 1d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
settlement_lag, trade_volume

### Data Formats
JSON, PARQUET

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

**Archetype:** Windowed Kpi  
**DAG Topology:** Linear  
**Steps Executed:** 7

**Design Rationale:**  
parallel ingestion of FIX and clearing house

**Trade-offs:**  
Caching PnL aggregates reduces query load 40%

## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

**Business Context**: In Finance, parallel ingestion of FIX and clearing house. This showcase validated the windowed kpi pattern for handling accounts, transactions data.

**Pipeline Execution**: ODIBI_CORE efficiently processed 7 steps across Linear topology in 0ms. The orchestrator fired 4 lifecycle events, providing real-time observability throughout the execution.

**Data Lineage**: Tracker captured 13 schema snapshots, preserving complete before/after states for audit trail. This demonstrates ODIBI_CORE's truth-preserving lineage - you can see exactly what happened to your data at each transformation step.

**Data Quality**: 1 validation checks ensured data integrity before publishing to the gold layer. Quality gates caught potential issues early, preventing bad data from reaching analytics consumers.

**Design Trade-offs**: Caching PnL aggregates reduces query load 40%. These choices balanced settlement_lag requirements with operational constraints.

**Framework Insight**: This domain-batch showcase exercised 7 ODIBI_CORE components (ConfigLoader, Orchestrator, Tracker, EventEmitter, DAGBuilder, DAGExecutor), demonstrating seamless integration across the native stack. No external dependencies - pure Python orchestration.
