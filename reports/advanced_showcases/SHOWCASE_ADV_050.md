## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
311 response time up 18% in District 5

### Backstory
311 response time up 18% in District 5. The PublicData organization needs a robust pipeline to process 311_requests, weather_stations, traffic_sensors data from multiple sources (CSV, PARQUET, JSON). Key metrics like service_coverage and violation_resolution_rate require real-time aggregation with proper data quality controls.

### Data Goal
Build a multi source conformance pipeline that consolidates 3-format sources, calculates service_coverage, violation_resolution_rate, and refreshes every 1d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
service_coverage, violation_resolution_rate

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET, JSON
