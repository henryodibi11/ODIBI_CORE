## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Budget variance analysis needs trend detection

### Backstory
In the PublicData domain, budget variance analysis needs trend detection. The current system ingests data from AVRO, JSON sources, but lacks proper permits, traffic_sensors, weather_stations reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles windowed kpi patterns to improve violation_resolution_rate and permit_approval_days visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a windowed kpi pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates violation_resolution_rate, permit_approval_days, and refreshes every 365d with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
violation_resolution_rate, permit_approval_days

### Data Formats
AVRO, JSON
