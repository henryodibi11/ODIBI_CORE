## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
ETA prediction accuracy at 67%

### Backstory
In the Logistics domain, eta prediction accuracy at 67%. The current system ingests data from AVRO, JSON sources, but lacks proper exceptions, shipments, orders reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles windowed kpi patterns to improve cost_per_mile and on_time_percentage visibility.

### Data Goal
Build a windowed kpi pipeline that consolidates 2-format sources, calculates cost_per_mile, on_time_percentage, and refreshes every 15min with full data quality validation.

### KPIs Tracked
cost_per_mile, on_time_percentage

### Data Formats
AVRO, JSON
