## 📖 Business Context

### Problem Statement
Peak demand forecast off by 12%

### Backstory
In the Energy domain, peak demand forecast off by 12%. The current system ingests data from CSV, PARQUET sources, but lacks proper transformers, demand_forecasts, readings reconciliation. This showcase demonstrates how ODIBI_CORE handles windowed kpi patterns to improve forecast_accuracy and peak_demand visibility.

### Data Goal
Orchestrate a high-complexity pipeline using ODIBI_CORE's native stack to track forecast_accuracy, peak_demand with 1h refresh cycles and automated validation.

### KPIs Tracked
forecast_accuracy, peak_demand

### Data Formats
CSV, PARQUET
