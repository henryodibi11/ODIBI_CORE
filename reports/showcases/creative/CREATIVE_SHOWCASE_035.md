## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> This medium pipeline in the Manufacturing domain successfully orchestrated 9 steps using ODIBI_CORE's native framework, demonstrating the power of event-driven, DAG-based data engineering.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize medium-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Conditional DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 4 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **Manufacturing** domain
