## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> This run demonstrated how PandasEngineContext handles branching patterns, revealing 7 steps executed smoothly.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize medium-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Branching DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 3 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **Manufacturing** domain
