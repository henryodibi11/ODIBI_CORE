## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> This medium pipeline showed how ODIBI_CORE scales from single-source ingestion to multi-format merging with validation.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize medium-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Linear DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 6 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **Healthcare** domain

---

## 🎓 Educational Value

### ConfigLoader Insights
- Parsed JSON configuration with 8 steps
- Normalized into `Step` dataclass instances
