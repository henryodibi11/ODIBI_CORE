## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> ODIBI_CORE learned that Diamond DAGs benefit from sequential ordering, reducing execution time by 26%.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize advanced-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Diamond DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 6 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **IoT** domain
