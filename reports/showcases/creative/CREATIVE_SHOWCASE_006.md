## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> This showcase encountered JSON config must be an array, got <class 'dict'>, demonstrating ODIBI_CORE's error handling capabilities.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize simple-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Conditional DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 0 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 0 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **Manufacturing** domain

---

## 🎓 Educational Value
