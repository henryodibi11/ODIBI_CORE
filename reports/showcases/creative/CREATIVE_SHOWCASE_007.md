## 💎 What Makes ODIBI_CORE Unique

🎯 **Native DAG Orchestration** - No Airflow, no Prefect - pure Python dependency resolution  
🔍 **Truth-Preserving Lineage** - Tracker captures every transformation with before/after snapshots  
🏅 **Medallion-First Architecture** - Bronze (raw) → Silver (clean) → Gold (business) layering built-in  
⚡ **Event-Driven Observability** - Real-time lifecycle hooks without external monitoring tools  
🧩 **Config-Driven Pipelines** - Entire DAG defined in JSON/SQL, zero hardcoding required  
📊 **Auto-Generated Stories** - HTML visualizations show exactly what happened to your data

## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> Event-driven hooks captured 4 lifecycle events, enabling real-time observability.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize simple-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Cascade DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 7 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **Logistics** domain

## 🏅 Medallion Architecture Walkthrough

This showcase demonstrates ODIBI_CORE's medallion-first design:

**🥉 Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion)**
- Ingested raw data from multiple sources
- Created initial datasets with standardized schemas
- No transformations - pure data capture

**🥈 Silver Layer (Transformation & Quality)**
- Applied 2 transformation steps
- Sequential transformations
- No validation in this simple pipeline

**🥇 Gold Layer (Business-Ready)**
- Published final dataset ready for analytics
- Schema: Enriched with calculated fields
- Quality: Unvalidated (simple pipeline)

## 🔬 Component Spotlight

### ConfigLoader
**What it did:** Loaded 6 steps from JSON configuration  
**Why it matters:** Zero hardcoding - entire pipeline defined declaratively  
**Concrete example:** Parsed step dependencies automatically (e.g., `merge_sources` depends on all `ingest_*` steps)

### Orchestrator + DAGBuilder
**What it did:** Built Cascade DAG with 6 nodes, resolved dependencies  
**Why it matters:** Automatic parallel execution - runs independent steps concurrently  
**Concrete example:** Detected 6 steps can run in optimal order based on dependencies

### Tracker (Truth-Preserving Lineage)
**What it did:** Captured 7 snapshots showing data evolution  
**Why it matters:** Full auditability - see exactly what changed at each step  
**Concrete example:** Tracked schema changes (columns added/removed) and row deltas (filtering/merging)

### EventEmitter (Observability)
**What it did:** Fired 4 event types (pipeline_complete, step_start)  
**Why it matters:** Real-time hooks for monitoring without external tools  
**Concrete example:** Fired `pipeline_start`, `step_start`, `step_complete`, `pipeline_complete` for full visibility

### PandasEngineContext
**What it did:** Executed all transformations using Pandas with DuckDB SQL support  
**Why it matters:** Engine abstraction - swap to SparkEngineContext for big data  
**Concrete example:** Same config runs on Pandas locally or Spark in Databricks
