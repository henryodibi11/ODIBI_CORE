## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> The bronze layer's cache proved critical for track end-to-end delivery times, validating DAG-based orchestration.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize simple-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Cascade DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 7 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **Logistics** domain
