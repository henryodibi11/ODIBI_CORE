## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> This advanced pipeline in the Logistics domain successfully orchestrated 8 steps using ODIBI_CORE's native framework, demonstrating the power of event-driven, DAG-based data engineering.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize advanced-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Branching DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 3 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **Logistics** domain
