## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> Event-driven hooks captured 4 lifecycle events, enabling real-time observability.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize simple-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Parallel DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 8 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **Logistics** domain
