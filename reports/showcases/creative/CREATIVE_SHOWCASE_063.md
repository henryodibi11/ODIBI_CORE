## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> This run demonstrated how PandasEngineContext handles conditional patterns, revealing 9 steps executed smoothly.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize medium-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Conditional DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 8 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **Entertainment** domain
