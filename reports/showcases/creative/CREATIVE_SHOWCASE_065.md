## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> The bronze layer's validate proved critical for identify equipment anomalies before failure, validating DAG-based orchestration.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize medium-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Conditional DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 8 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **IoT** domain
