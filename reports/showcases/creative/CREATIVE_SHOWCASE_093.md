## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> This run demonstrated how ConfigLoader handles linear patterns, revealing 10 steps executed smoothly.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize advanced-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Linear DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 6 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **Healthcare** domain
