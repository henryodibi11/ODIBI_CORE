## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> ODIBI_CORE learned that Parallel DAGs benefit from parallel execution, reducing execution time by 29%.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize simple-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Parallel DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 8 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **Healthcare** domain
