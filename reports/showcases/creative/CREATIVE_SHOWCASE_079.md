## 🧠 What ODIBI_CORE Learned

> **Reflection:**  
> This advanced pipeline showed how ODIBI_CORE scales from single-source ingestion to multi-format merging with validation.

This showcase validated ODIBI_CORE's ability to:
- ✅ Load and normalize advanced-complexity configurations
- ✅ Build and execute Parallel DAG topologies
- ✅ Fire 4 lifecycle events for observability
- ✅ Track data lineage through 6 schema snapshots
- ✅ Orchestrate pipelines in the **IoT** domain
